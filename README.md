# TO-DO NEXT.JS WEB APP

This project´s purpose is to get into `NEXT.JS` framework, trying to explore it´s key features:

- Server-side rendering
- Client-side rendering
- Routes index functionality
- Latest next.js news

## About 

I am following `NEXT.JS`documentation, which can be found on the link below:

<https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started> 

The main idea is to use a `REST API` for a CRUD application, where user can initially see all previous registered 
tasks, edit or delete them, using next.js routes system.

The base for it is `React` and web basics.

## BACK-END

Using a very interesting library called `json-server`, which after little to no configs, set up a REST API, according
to a json file.

The link for `json-server` npm description below:

<https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server>

## STARTING IT UP

Starting with basic dev mode, which means, one service instance for the backend and another one for the front-end.
